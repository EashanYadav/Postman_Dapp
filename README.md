# Postman  
A Decentralized Document Verification System Website on Blockchain

This project demonstrates of how people can upload their official documents on this webiste which will be stored on IPFS. The backend of this project is completely decentralized as it is built on Blockchain system and uses Ethereum for recording transactions

I have used Solidity language to write the smart contract and connected the front end with smart contract using Web3.js. The project is deployed on Hardhat metwork and all the changes are saved on IPFS which is a decentralized database platform.

# Commands to run the project
1)Clone the project from this GitHub repo

2) Open the project location in terminal

3) Install all the dependencies by running "npm install"

4) Run Hardhat nodes by writing "npx hardhat node"

5) Then spin your hardhat network by writing "npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js" on a new terminal window

6) Then on new terminal window type "cd client" and then type "npm start"

7) Then open metamask and connect one of your hardhat account to it by importing the account.
